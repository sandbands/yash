# Setting up yash

## Step 1. Building yash

#### You will need the GCC compiler for this.

Navigate to the yash directory and type 'make'

## Step 2. Additional Setup

Add the 'bin' (binary) directory to your System / Current shell's PATH Variable so you can launch yash without having to locate it

It is recommended that you place the root directory of yash in your home directory (Linux: /home/USERNAME/    Windows: C\\Users\\USERNAME).

So, (Linux: /home/USERNAME/yash		Windows: C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\yash)
# Updating yash
